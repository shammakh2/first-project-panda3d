# **Project 1: Report**

Developing with Python, Git and IDE is a very different experience from what I am used to from my own previous experience. I have not coded in Python and have not used an IDE for any kind of project before. I have used JavaScript, php and a bit of C++ for my projects till now. There are also many things that I learnt in this practical that I have been using before without realizing it. This report will give further details of what I have used and what I have learnt from the tools mentioned in this practical.

##### 1. Print “hello world”

The `Print(“Hello world”)` command I have used extensively in any and all projects that I have done. It wasn’t the same, but it was in a similar form and for the purpose of testing and debugging. It was always in the form of a quick feedback code which would tell me quickly what works and what doesn’t, and it also allowed me to quickly pin point errors or inconsistencies in the code.

##### 2. The editor

I learned to code on my own. It was what I did as a hobby in my free time and I used and editor which would be classed as something that was between a “normal” editor and a power editor. I did tinker with a few IDEs, but I never used them and didn’t completely understand what an IDE was anyway. I believe that an IDE is good for beginners and PyCharm has helped me learn a lot of things quickly, and I has also, along with the instructions in the practical have helped me understand and better visualize what is going on with the code and instructions I type or give.

##### 3. Version control and Git
Furthermore, I believe Git will be one of the best tools that I am learning to use. I have been exposed to Git multiple times before, but I avoided it because of its complexity but a simple introduction made it easier to comprehend even though it doesn’t cover the complexity of Git. 
I have realized the importance and the benefit of Git and version control systems and how allowing massive global collaboration with the help of version control and still maintaining file records has had a revolutionizing impact on software development.

##### 4. Markdown and Documentation
Also, I have been exposed to documentation in projects, especially large scale projects and programs, and the purpose of writing them. As one of our lecturers said, programming languages are there for humans to understand and proper, accurate documentation plays a huge part in the understanding of a program 

##### 5. Dependencies and Libraries
The introduction to dependencies, I believe, will be a great asset for me. Even though it comes with its drawbacks, like dependency hell, it still has benefits like being able to use other people’s work to make, enhance or modify your own. This speed up the process a lot and everyone doesn’t need to type lines of code to accomplish the same purpose as other people. This also improves quality of work in some sense because everyone just needs to worry about making their code or project to work as efficiently and as best as possible and the people who build over it will have higher standard to start with and only needs to work on the stuff they wrote.

##### Finally
To conclude, this report outlines the new things and tools that the first practical project has introduced me to and predicts the tools that will be valuable assets for me in the field of computer science and software development.
